NAME
    Test::Chimps::Client - Send smoke test results to a server

SYNOPSIS
    This module simplifies the process of sending smoke test results (in the
    form of "Test::TAP::Model"s) to a smoke server.

        use Test::Chimps::Client;
        use Test::TAP::Model::Visual;

        chdir "some/module/directory";

        my $model = Test::TAP::Model::Visual->new_with_tests(glob("t/*.t"));

        my $client = Test::Chimps::Client->new(
          server => 'http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/smoke-server.pl',
          model  => $model
        );

        my ($status, $msg) = $client->send;

        if (! $status) {
          print "Error: $msg\n";
          exit(1);
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Chimps is the Collaborative Heterogeneous Infinite Monkey
    Perfectionification Service. It is a framework for storing, viewing,
    generating, and uploading smoke reports.

    This distribution provides client-side modules and binaries for Chimps.

METHODS
  new ARGS
    Creates a new Client object. ARGS is a hash whose valid keys are:

    *   file

        Mandatory. The value must be a "Test::TAP::Model". These are the
        test results that will be submitted to the server.

    *   report_variables

        Optional. A hashref of report variables and values to send to the
        server.

    *   server

        Mandatory. The URI of the server script to upload the model to.

  send
    Submit the specified model to the server. This function's return value
    is a list, the first of which indicates success or failure, and the
    second of which is an error string.

ACCESSORS
    There are read-only accessors for model, report_variables, and server.
